Both foldes contain a shapefiles folder, which includes the used polygons (see README file there) to present the maps of the city and calculate the intersections, and also an X.txt file which contains the incidence matrix for each city. The X.txt file is an space separated values file representing a matrix. Columns of the matrix represent the tracts of the city (corresponding to "GEOID" and "name" columns of Boston and LA shapefiles respectively) and rows correspond to the parks (corresponding to the column "new_id" of the Boston_parks.geojson and LosAngeles_parks.geojson respectively). Elements of the matrix correspond to the number of potential visits from a tract to a park, using a radius of 200 meters in both cities. As the columns and rows and reversed, the X.txt file contains the transpose of the X matrix described in the manuscript.
